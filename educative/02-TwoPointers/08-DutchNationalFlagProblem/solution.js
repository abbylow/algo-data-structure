 * Question: https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview/RMBxV6jz6Q0
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
 * Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
 * Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
